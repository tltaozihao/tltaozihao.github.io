excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a novel and convenient Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) monitoring and control platform based on Virtual Reality (VR) system and virtual rocker control system. In general, conventional monitoring and control platforms for ROV is bulky and lack of real-world interaction. To overcome these problems, we design a portable monitor and control platform that offers 3D visualization and control interface based on mobile phone. Besides, to improve the immersion perception of mobile phone VR platform, an algorithm based on Kalman filter is proposed to improve the accuracy of controlling data. Active shutter technology is also applied to enhance the image resolution in VR visualization.'
